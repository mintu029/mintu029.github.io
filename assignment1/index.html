    <h2>My first impression when interacting with the experience</h2> 

    <p> 

      My first impression of the interactive experience on the Gretty website 

      was that of experiencing music along with abstract artistic images. It was 

      surprising that a website could effectively combine orchestral music and 

      artistic sketches. 

    </p> 

    <h2>My actions for two minutes for experience</h2> 

    <ul> 

    <div class="mycontainer"> 

 

      <div style="background-color:#fffffe;"> 

        <p1>First of all, about the interaction with the text, it is really impressive because the height and shape of the text will change when the mouse pointer moves. And when moving the mouse pointer on the bold text, we can recognize the content next to it that the author wants to mention.</p1> 

      </div> 

       

      <div style="background-color:#33bb95;"> 

        <p1>Next, the description is clearly described in terms of content so that viewers can easily understand everything about Gretty. When they see the image with clear content, it will make viewers more interested and seem like they are lost in a real exhibition.</p1> 

      </div> 

       

      <div style="background-color:#ffffff;"> 

        <p1>The sans serif font reduces the formality when presenting the work to everyone, creating a friendly and close feeling (ref). I think reducing the formality here is necessary because the orchestral music has created a rather formal feeling. Therefore, to easily approach website users, especially generation Z and generation Y (the generation that mainly accesses digital technology) (ref here).</p1> 

      </div> 

     

    <div style="background-color:#33bb95;"> 

        <p1>The transition is smooth, when scrolling down, everything seems smooth and linked together. The images appear one after another, making us feel more and more attracted.</p1> 

      </div> 

    </ul> 

    <h2>The experience I spent the most time on</h2> 

    <p> 

      I probably spent the most time on the “FRANK GEHRY, ARCHITECT” experience. 

      Because if I watch it carefully, it helps me understand more about the 

      engineering work and its story. Not only do I explore the architect’s 

      story, I also explore the model on the left side of the screen. 

    </p>

      <img src="Screenshot 2025-03-30 at 1.59.21 pm.png" width="700" height="350" >  

   </div> 

   

    <h2>Common action in two minutes experience</h2> 

    <p> 

      The transitions are pretty smooth so I find that if I scroll down to get 

      to the next section, the previous sections will be sucked away, which 

      feels quite interesting. So I really enjoy the action of scrolling down to 

      get to other sections of this website. 

    </p> 

    <h2> 

      My impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience 

    </h2> 

    <p> 

      This exhibition delves into the design and development of the Walt Disney 

      Concert Hall, highlighting Frank Gehry's collaborative process and the 

      innovative models used to bring this architectural landmark to life. So I 

      was quite impressed by the boldness of thinking and bringing those 

      thoughts to life. 

    </p> 

    <h2>The main goal that the Interactive Experience conveys</h2> 

    <p> 

      The website offers a rich interactive experience to convey the primary 

      goal of the exhibition “Sculpting Harmony: Frank Gehry and the Walt Disney 

      Concert Hall.” Users can explore more than 150 models, sketches, and 

      images related to Frank Gehry’s design process for the Walt Disney Concert 

      Hall. In particular, the website allows interaction with Gehry’s study 

      models, allowing viewers to rotate and zoom in for detailed observations, 

      along with highlights that provide additional information about specific 

      design elements. 

    </p> 

    <h2>My impressions of how the experience interacts over time</h2> 

    <p> 

      I spend an average of 15-20 minutes getting an overview of the exhibition. 

      But to explore each simulation in detail and conduct interviews, I spend 

      30-45 minutes or more.

   </div> <br>
    <p> 
      I interacted with the website many times to understand it. The first time 

      I explored the whole thing, I experienced the interactions of the website 

      and the 3D model, the video. The second time I went back to explore the 

      model and the content inside in detail. The next times I watched to 

      understand more about the architecture and design that the author wanted 

      to bring.

      journey of discovery that allows viewers to still immerse themselves in 

      the works. 

    </p> 

    <h2>The experiential actions I learned from this reference</h2> 

    <h3>Guide to research approach</h3> 

    <ul> 
        <div class="tu"> 
      <li> 

        Timeline Discovery – The experience is designed to allow users to 

        explore information in a progressive manner. This emphasizes the 

        importance of approaching research in a structured way, from the 

        ideation stage to the creation of a finished product. 

      </li> 
</div>
<div class="vie"> 
      <li> 

        Focus on engagement – Rather than just passively receiving information, 

        the experience encourages users to participate, explore patterns and 

        materials. This suggests that in research, we should actively explore, 

        practice discovering new experiences and analyze instead of just reading 

        documents. 

      </li> 
</div>
    </ul> 

    <h3>Methods of organizing and presenting research</h3> 

    <ul> 
        <div class="tu"> 
      <li> 

        Incorporate multiple media – We can try to combine multiple experiences 

        such as using hand drawings, 3D models, videos, interviews, and audio to 

        convey information. This shows that research should have a diverse 

        approach, not only relying on text but also incorporating images, data, 

        and even audio or visual models. 

      </li> 
</div>
<div class="vie"> 
      <li> 

        Detail each section – Each model or drawing has additional information 

        to help the viewer understand it better. This emphasizes the importance 

        of providing context and explanation in research, rather than simply 

        presenting facts. 

      </li> 
</div>
    </ul> 

    <h3>How to act during the research process</h3> 

    <ul> 
        <div class="tu"> 
      <li> 

        Engage with multiple sources – Don’t just rely on one source. Combine 

        historical documents, empirical analysis, numerical data, and visual 

        information to get a comprehensive view. It’s essential to enrich your 

        research. 

      </li> 
</div>
<div class="vie"> 
      <li> 
        Learn from experts & real-world feedback – The site features interviews 

        with Frank Gehry, showing that the research comes not just from books 

        but also from expert conversations and real-world analysis. This is also 

        a fun way to get a closer look. 
      </li> 
</div>
<div class="tu"> 
      <li> 
        Practical application & testing of ideas – The fact that users can 

        rotate and observe 3D models suggests that research is not just 

        theoretical, but also requires practical testing (e.g. creating models, 

        testing AI, collecting real data). 
      </li> 
</div>
    </ul> 
    <p> 

      So when engaging in a research experience, we should explore in a 

      structured way, use multiple interactive methods, diversify our sources, 

      and combine practice with theory for a more comprehensive and in-depth 

      view. 
    </p> 
    <h2>The experiential feel I learned from this reference</h2> 
    <p>Referencing Frank Gehry’s design process for the Walt Disney Concert Hall conveys that engaging in research involves having a clear goal, understanding the purpose of the project, and understanding how to work as a team. Combining hands-on craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology, research requires flexibility and creativity. It is not just an individual effort, but a collective effort. It teaches us to adapt to constraints and balance aesthetic goals and encourages a mindset of continuous learning.</p>
    <h2>What annoys me the most about participating in interactive experiences</h2> 
    <p>When you first enter the experience, tap on the bold text "SCUPTING HARMONY" and you will be able to read the accompanying content. But I find it very difficult to read all the content, it is very difficult for them to show all the content. Surely that's the most frustrating part of the experience of interacting with the website.</p>

      <img src="Screenshot 2025-04-01 at 8.59.00 pm.png" width="700" height="350" >
     </div>
     <h2>What satisfies me the most about interacting with the website</h2>
     <p>Still like the above answers, what impresses me the most is the sound and abstract art. Because I graduated from the Ho Chi Minh Conservatory, so music is an integral part of my life, and I have encountered orchestral music combined with vivid and artistic developments.</p>
